# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Blender file `hardware/blender/superlens.blend` (assembly + print layout) and its build script.

## [rev B] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- Solderless build: a pre-soldered XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, Dupont plugs and WAGO 221 lever connectors replace the soldered distribution board.
- The user's power bank now plugs straight into the XIAO's USB-C port, and the 5V pin feeds the sensors.
- M3 screws thread-form into PETG, so heat-set inserts are no longer needed.
- The tripod mount uses a captive 1/4"-20 nut instead of a heat-set insert.

### Added
- Desk stand that holds the grip so the head stays level.
- Print-bed orientations in the CAD source (`PART="print_*"`) and export scripts.

### Removed
- Trigger button, USB-C input breakout, switch cable and bulk capacitor.

## [rev A] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- First enclosure: head, back cover with pressing columns, raked pistol grip, lidar check template.
